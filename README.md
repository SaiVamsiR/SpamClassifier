# SpamClassifier
# Overview

This project aims to classify messsages as spam or non-spam (ham) using two popular machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes and Random Forest.


## Introduction

Spam messages are unsolicited and unwanted messages sent in bulk, often for commercial purposes. This project focuses on building a spam classifier using machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and filter out messages.


## Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. It is commonly used for text classification tasks like spam filtering.

## Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. It is known for its high accuracy and robustness.
